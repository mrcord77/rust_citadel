[INFO] ESCALATE :: Threat score: 102, Level: 5 (CRITICAL)
[PASS] ESCALATE :: Reached CRITICAL (level 5)
[INFO] FLOORS :: Policy compression at current threat level:
[PASS] FLOORS ::   Default DEK Policy rotation: 90d to 18d (floor: 1d)
[PASS] FLOORS ::   Default DEK Policy grace: 7d to 0.7d (floor: 0.5d)
[PASS] FLOORS ::   Default DEK Policy max_life: 365d to 91.25d (floor: 30d)
