# Citadel: Post-Quantum Key Management for Enterprise Applications

## The Problem

NIST mandates post-quantum cryptography migration by 2035. Most organizations encrypt sensitive data with algorithms that quantum computers will break. The challenge isn't just swapping algorithms — it's managing the key lifecycle: rotation, revocation, access control, audit trails, and compliance reporting across thousands of keys.

"Harvest now, decrypt later" attacks mean data encrypted today with classical-only algorithms is already at risk if it has long-term sensitivity (healthcare records, financial data, government communications, intellectual property).

## What Citadel Does

Citadel is a self-hosted key management server that handles post-quantum encryption for your applications. Your application calls Citadel's API to encrypt and decrypt data. Citadel manages everything else: key generation, rotation schedules, access control, threat response, and audit logging.

**Your application never touches raw key material.**

## How It Works

```
Your App                    Citadel                      Storage
   |                          |                            |
   |-- encrypt(data, aad) --> |                            |
   |                          |-- generate AES-256 key     |
   |                          |-- encrypt with AES-256-GCM |
   |                          |-- wrap key with hybrid KEM |
   |                          |   (X25519 + ML-KEM-768)    |
   | <-- encrypted blob ----- |                            |
   |                          |                            |
   |-- store blob ---------------------------------------->|
```

The encrypted blob is self-contained and self-describing. It includes the wrapped key, algorithm identifiers, and ciphertext. Your database schema doesn't change. Your application code is a dozen lines.

## Security Architecture

| Layer | Implementation | Standard |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| Key encapsulation | X25519 + ML-KEM-768 (hybrid) | FIPS 203 + RFC 7748 |
| Data encryption | AES-256-GCM | NIST SP 800-38D |
| Key derivation | HKDF-SHA256 | NIST SP 800-56C |
| Key hierarchy | Root > Domain > KEK > DEK | NIST SP 800-57 |
| Threat response | 5-level adaptive system | Policy-driven |
| Audit | Integrity-chained JSONL | Tamper-evident |

Hybrid construction means security holds if **either** X25519 or ML-KEM remains secure. This is defense-in-depth for the PQC transition period.

## Deployment

Citadel ships as a single Docker container. Add it to your existing stack:

```yaml
services:
  citadel:
    image: citadel:latest
    environment:
      CITADEL_API_KEY_HASH: "${API_KEY_HASH}"
      CITADEL_SEED_DEMO: "true"
    volumes:
      - citadel-data:/data
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
```

Production deployment includes Caddy for TLS termination, per-IP rate limiting, and scoped API keys for separation of duties.

## Integration

```python
# Encrypt a patient record
blob = citadel.encrypt(
    key_id=dek_id,
    plaintext=json.dumps(record),
    aad=record_id,           # Binds ciphertext to this record
    context="patient-records" # Domain separation
)
db.store(record_id, blob)    # Store encrypted blob

# Decrypt
blob = db.fetch(record_id)
record = citadel.decrypt(blob, aad=record_id, context="patient-records")
```

AAD binding prevents record substitution attacks — swapping ciphertext between records causes decryption to fail.

## Compliance

Citadel maps to 34 controls in NIST SP 800-57: 26 satisfied, 7 partially satisfied, 1 gap. See COMPLIANCE_MATRIX.md for the full mapping.

| Framework | Relevant Controls |
|-----------|------------------|
| NIST SP 800-57 | Key lifecycle, hierarchy, crypto-periods |
| NIST SP 800-131A | Algorithm transition (classical to PQC) |
| CNSA 2.0 | ML-KEM-768 meets 2025 software requirement |
| HIPAA | Encryption at rest, access controls, audit logs |
| SOC 2 | Logical access, key management, monitoring |

## Current Status

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Core encryption (citadel-envelope) | Working, tested, fuzz-tested |
| Key management (citadel-keystore) | Working, 4-level hierarchy |
| API server (citadel-api) | Working, authenticated, rate-limited |
| Dashboard | Working, real-time threat visualization |
| Independent audit | **Not yet completed** |
| Production deployments | **None yet** |
| FIPS validation | **Not applicable** (uses NIST algorithms, not FIPS-validated module) |

## What Independent Audit Would Cover

A lightweight audit (~$20-40K, firms like NCC Group or Trail of Bits) would review:

1. Hybrid KEM composition correctness
2. KDF domain separation and binding
3. Wire format parsing for memory safety
4. Side-channel resistance on reference hardware
5. Key lifecycle state machine completeness
6. Error handling (no decryption oracle leaks)

## Engagement Models

| Model | Scope | Timeline |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Migration assessment | Inventory current crypto, identify harvest-now risks, prioritize | 2-4 weeks |
| Proof of concept | Deploy Citadel with one application, validate integration | 4-6 weeks |
| Full deployment | Production rollout, monitoring, compliance documentation | 3-6 months |
| Ongoing support | Key rotation oversight, threat monitoring, audit prep | Retainer |
